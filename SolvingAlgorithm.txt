1. Fill in obvious cells
2. Make a guess
	Does this work without contradicting the clues?
		if so: Move on to step 3
		if not: Make opposite guess.
			Does it work without contradicting the clues?
				if so: Move on to step 3
				if not: Pop guess off stack and revert it 
3. Push guess on to the guess stack
4. Fill in obvious cells based on guess
	Does this work without contradicting the clues?
	if so: Go back to step 2
	if not: revert the cells filled in in step 4
		pop guess off stack and revert it
		Go back to step 2
Repeat until solved (i.e. the end of the board is reached without causing a contradiction)
